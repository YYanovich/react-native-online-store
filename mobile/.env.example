# Expo public API base URL used by mainAxios.
# During development the app derives the LAN IP from the Expo host automatically
# and falls back to this value if auto-detection fails.
# For iOS Simulator you can use http://localhost:3030
# For Android Emulator use http://10.0.2.2:3030
# For production, set the deployed backend URL explicitly.
